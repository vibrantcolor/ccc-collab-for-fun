# ccc-collab-for-fun

The focus of this repo is not on the project itself but on trying stuff and interacting with fellow students.

## Tech Stack

The application in the first commit is a classic MVC dynamic page (for now) and the tech stack is:

- Spring for backend
- Spring modules: Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, etc
- Postgres for db
- Thymeleaf as templating engine.
